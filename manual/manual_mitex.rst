MitEx
*****

A core process of many NISQ applications, such as variational algorithms, is the evaluation of the
average value of observables for some circuit. This corresponds to measuring the expected value of 
the bit strings returned by measured qubit shots.

During a typical flow one: defines an ansatz circuit and an observable, 
produces an appropriate set of measurement circuits, executes all these measurement circuits
on a device, calculates their expectation values,
and then modifies them by some coefficients, leaving an estimation of the expectation value of the observable.


In its basic capacity, the ``MitEx.run`` `method <https://cqcl.github.io/qermit/mitex.html>`_ will run each of these
tasks sequentially, automating the procedure.

::

    from qermit import MitEx
    from pytket.extensions.qiskit import AerBackend

    mitex = MitEx(backend = AerBackend())
    mitex.get_task_graph()

While the arguments to ``MitRes`` will be intuitive to anyone who has used ``pytket`` before, the arguments
to ``MitEx`` may require more consideration (though hopefully sensical to someone who has run an experiment estimating
the expectation of an observable before, such as a Variational Quantum Eigensolver experiment).

The ``MitEx.run`` method takes ``List[ObservableExperiment]`` as an argument, and returns ``List[QubitPauliOperator]``.
An ``ObservableExperiment`` is a type defined to include the miniumum amount of information necessary to estimate
an observable with error-mitigation. ``ObservableExperiment`` is a ``namedtuple`` with two elements, an ``AnsatzCircuit`` and an ``ObservableTracker``.

An ``AnsatzCircuit`` ``Tuple`` has three elements, a ``Circuit``, the number of device shots to take of ``Circuit`` 
when running on a device, and a ``SymbolsDict`` holding a dictionary between symbolic parameters in the ``Circuit`` and 
parameters to subsitute them with. The ``Circuit`` object should have no ``Measure`` gates, as these will be added
during ``qermit`` runtime as measurement circuits are produced.

Note that currently ``qermit`` can not run variational experiments, but a collection of
experiments with different parameters can be passed to ``MitEx.run`` at the same time, and the same error-mitigation 
characteriastions will be used for different experiments where possible.

`QubitPauliOperator <https://cqcl.github.io/pytket/build/html/utils.html?highlight=qubitpaulioperator#pytket.utils.QubitPauliOperator>`_ is 
a generic data structure from ``pytket`` that contains a dictionary from ``QubitPauliString`` to
a float (for ``qermit`` usage). A `QubitPauliString <https://cqcl.github.io/pytket/build/html/pauli.html?highlight=qubitpaulistring#pytket.pauli.QubitPauliString>`_ 
is a string of Pauli letters (as used to define Observables to be measured), indexed by a ``Pytket`` ``Qubit``.

Finally, an ``ObservableTracker`` is an object defined by a ``QubitPauliOperator`` that keeps track of both
the observable being measured and the measurement circuits required to do so. 

::

    from qermit import AnsatzCircuit, SymbolsDict
    from pytket.circuit import Circuit, fresh_symbol

    sym = fresh_symbol("test")
    circuit = Circuit(3,3).X(0).X(1).Rz(sym, 2)
    shots = 300
    symbols = SymbolsDict.symbols_from_dict({test: 0.0})
    ansatz_circuit = AnsatzCircuit(Circuit=circuit, Shots=shots, SymbolsDict=symbols)

::

    AnsatzCircuit(Circuit=[X q[0]; X q[1]; Rz(test) q[2]; ], Shots=300, SymbolsDict=<SymbolsDict::1>)

:: 

    from pytket import Qubit
    from pytket.pauli import Pauli, QubitPauliString
    from pytket.utils import QubitPauliOperator

    qubit_pauli_string = QubitPauliString([Qubit(1), Qubit(2)], [Pauli.Z, Pauli.Z])
    qubit_pauli_operator = QubitPauliOperator({qubit_pauli_string: 1.0})

    print(qubit_pauli_operator)

::

    {(Zq[1], Zq[2]): 1.00000000000000}

:: 
    
    from qermit import ObservableTracker

    observable_tracker = ObservableTracker(qubit_pauli_operator)

    print(observable_tracker)

::

    <ObservableTracker::0MeasurementCircuits>

``MitEx`` will produce and keep track of measurement circuits as it runs, we simply need to construct the object from a ``QubitPauliOperator`` as an argument.

::

    from qermit import ObservableExperiment

    observable_experiment = ObservableExperiment(AnsatzCircuit = ansatz_circuit, ObservableTracker = observable_tracker)

    print(observable_experiment)

::

    ObservableExperiment(AnsatzCircuit=AnsatzCircuit(Circuit=[X q[0]; X q[1]; Rz(test) q[2]; ], Shots=300, SymbolsDict=<SymbolsDict::1>), ObservableTracker=<ObservableTracker::0MeasurementCircuits>)

The ``MitEx.run`` method takes ``List[ObservableExperiment]`` as an argument, each ``ObservableExperiment`` representing
a different estimation for a different circuit. For each ``ObservableExperiment`` a ``QubitPauliOperator`` is returned, giving
the expectation value for each ``QubitPauliString`` in the operator.

::

    results = mitex.run([observable_experiment])
    print(results)

::  

    [{(Zq[1], Zq[2]): -1.00000000000000}]


The ``MitEx`` constructor has a ``mitres`` keyword, which if passed a ``MitRes`` object will construct the resulting ``MitEx`` 
from it. This is similar in spirit to the combining of error-mitigation methods discussed in "Combining ``MitRes`` methods".



Error-mitigation with ``MitEx``
-------------------------------

As with ``MitRes``, to produce a ``MitEx`` object that executes an error-mitigation
protocol when ``MitEx.run`` is called, additional ``MitTask`` objects need to be added
to the task graph.

The defining characteristic of a ``MitEx`` object is that the first ``MitTask`` object 
in its sorted graph requires a ``List[ObservableExperiment]`` object as its sole argument and that
the final ``MitTask`` object in its sorted graph returns a ``List[QubitPauliOperator]`` object. 
As with ``MitRes``, this is a crucial type constraint required for the combining of error-mitigation methods.

Once more, there are two viable approaches for producing error-mitigation ``MitEx`` objects, either
extending a ``MitEx`` object with new ``MitTask`` objects under strict type constraints, or constructing 
a ``TaskGraph`` object with relaxed type constraints on internal tasks and then casting to a ``MitEx`` object at completion.

The ``MitRes`` section of the manual explains constructing a ``TaskGraph`` in great detail and as the process
is nearly identical for ``MitEx`` we will not explain this again here - if you are interested please refer to that section
of the manual. However, we will consider extending a ``MitEx`` object with new ``MitTask`` objects so as
to show the type constraints explicitly.

Extending ``MitEx`` with ``MitTask``
------------------------------------

The ``MitEx.append`` and ``MitEx.prepend`` methods can be used to extend the 
``MitTask`` objects the ``MitEx._task_graph`` attribute holds.

In some estimation experiments, a priori knowledge about the circuit structure and observable measured can be utilised to discard Shots. 
This can happen when, for example, some combination of Bits has a value which is known to be impossible. An example
of a formal approach to such a method is *symmetry verification* [Bonet-Monroig2018]_.

As an example, let's construct a ``MitEx`` object that performs a very basic version of this. While this example
will lack physical meaning, it will display how such a method could be written.

::

    from qermit import MitTask
    from typing import List, Tuple
    from pytket import Bit

    def add_ancillas_task_gen(ancillas: List[Tuple[Qubit, Qubit, Bit]]) -> MitTask:
        def task(obj, experiment_wire: List[ObservableExperiment]) -> Tuple[List[ObservableExperiment]]:
            for entry in experiment_wire:
                c = entry.AnsatzCircuit.Circuit
                for tup in ancillas:
                    q0 = tup[0]
                    q1 = tup[1]
                    b = tup[2]
                    
                    # check tup is compatible with circuit
                    circuit_qubits = entry.AnsatzCircuit.Circuit.qubits
                    if q0 not in circuit_qubits:
                        raise ValueError("Circuit has no qubit {}.".format(q0))
                    if q1 in circuit_qubits:
                        raise ValueError("Circuit already has ancilla qubit {}.".format(q1))
                    if b in entry.AnsatzCircuit.Circuit.bits:
                        raise ValueError("Circuit already had bit {}.".format(b))
                    # add new Qubit, add CX between control and ancilla, add Measure
                    c.add_qubit(q1)
                    c.add_bit(b)
                    c.CX(q0, q1)
                    c.Measure(q1, b)
                print(c.get_commands())
            return (experiment_wire,)
        return MitTask(_label="AddMeasureAncillas", _n_in_wires=1, _n_out_wires=1, _method=task)


The ``add_ancillas_task_gen`` function returns a ``MitTask`` that modifies the ``AnsatzCircuit.Circuit`` to some specification,
adding measured ancilla ``Qubit``.  

::

    ancillas = [(Qubit(0), Qubit(3), Bit(3))]
    ancillas_task = add_ancillas_task_gen(ancillas)
    print(ancillas_task)

::

    <MitTask::AddMeasureAncillas>

::

    sim_backend = AerBackend()
    mitex_discard = MitEx(backend = sim_backend)
    mitex_discard.prepend(ancillas_task)
    mitex.get_task_graph()


.. image:: ancilla_mitex_taskgraph.png

Clearly this ``MitTask`` needs a later corresponding task to process these results. As mentioned earlier,
the ``MitEx`` constructor accepts a ``MitRes`` object from which it constructs its task graph. We can prepare
a ``MitTask`` that modifies ``BackendResult`` given a configuration related to ``ancillas_task`` and then prepend
it to the ``MitRes`` object used for constructing the ``MitEx`` object.

::

    from pytket.backends.backendresult import BackendResult
    from pytket.utils.outcomearray import OutcomeArray
    from typing import Counter

    def discard_counts_task_gen(to_discard: List[Tuple[Bit, bool]]) -> MitTask:
        def task(obj, results: List[BackendResult]) -> Tuple[List[BackendResult]]:
            updated_results = []
            for r in results:
                counts = r.get_counts()
                for tup in to_discard:
                    bit = tup[0]
                    # find entry in counts that corresponds to bit of choice
                    count_index = r.c_bits[bit]
                    for state in counts:
                        # bit of returned state is banned type
                        if state[count_index] == tup[1]:
                            # remove all counts for banned state
                            counts[state] = 0
                # convert updated Counter to a BackendResult object, add to new results
                counter = Counter(
                    {
                        OutcomeArray.from_readouts([key]): val
                        for key, val in counts.items()
                    }
                )
                updated_results.append(BackendResult(c_bits = r.c_bits, counts = counter))
            return (updated_results,)   
        return MitTask(_label="DiscardCountsTask", _n_in_wires=1, _n_out_wires=1, _method=task)

The ``discard_counts_task_gen`` function returns a ``MitTask`` object that assigns some counts results
in ``BackendResult`` to 0 if their Bitstring has some Bit in a specific state.

::

    discard_task = discard_counts_task_gen([(Bit(3), 0)])
    print(discard_task)

::

    <MitTask::DiscardCountsTask>


::

    from qermit.taskgraph import backend_compile_circuit_shots_task_gen


    mitres_discard = MitRes(backend = sim_backend)  
    mitres_discard.append(discard_task)
    mitres_discard.prepend(backend_compile_circuit_shots_task_gen(sim_backend, optimisation_level = 0))
    mitres_discard.get_task_graph()


.. image:: discard_mitres_taskgraph.png

Lets create a new ``MitEx`` object constructed from ``mitres_discard`` and then test it.

::

    combined_mitex = MitEx(sim_backend, mitres = mitres_discard)
    combined_mitex.prepend(add_ancillas_task_gen([(Qubit(0), Qubit(3), Bit(3))])

    combined_mitex.get_task_graph()

.. image:: combined_mitex_taskgraph.png

::

    sym_discard = fresh_symbol("discard_test")
    circuit_discard = Circuit(3,3).H(0).X(1).Rz(sym_discard, 2)
    shots = 500
    symbols = SymbolsDict.symbols_from_dict({sym_discard: 0.0})
    ansatz_circuit_discard = AnsatzCircuit(Circuit=circuit_discard, Shots=shots, SymbolsDict=symbols)

    qps = QubitPauliString([Qubit(0), Qubit(1), Qubit(2)], [Pauli.Z, Pauli.Z, Pauli.Z])
    qpo_discard = QubitPauliOperator({qps: 1.0})
    
    discard_results = discard_mitex.run([ObservableExperiment(ansatz_circuit_discard, ObservableTracker(qpo_discard))])
    print(discard_results)
    
::  

    [{(Zq[0], Zq[1], Zq[2]): 1.00000000000000}]

Without any modification, one would expect the Circuit and measured operator to return either (0,0,1) or (1,0,1) 
with equal probability, giving a returned expectation value close to 0.
However, with the additional ancilla qubit and discarding task, all shots returning (1,0,1) are discarded,
leaving an expectation of 1 generated from (0,0,1) shots only.

Considering the ``MitEx`` type constraints, we can also append ``MitTask`` that receive ``List[QubitPauliOperator]`` and
return ``Tuple[List[QubitPauliOperator]]``. 

::

    def modify_operator_task_gen(to_zero: float) -> MitTask:
        def task(obj, results: List[QubitPauliOperator]) -> Tuple[List[QubitPauliOperator]]:
            for operator in results:
                operator_dict = operator._dict
                for string in operator_dict:
                    # if absolute of value less than given value, set coefficient to zero
                    if abs(operator_dict[string]) < to_zero:
                        operator_dict[string] = 0
            return (results,)
        return MitTask(_label="ModifyOperator", _n_in_wires=1, _n_out_wires=1, _method = task)
    
As a simple example, this task iterates through every value of every ``QubitPauliOperator`` and sets the value to 0
if its value is within some passed range. A more realistic example may modify the values give some characterisation.

::

    discard_mitex.append(modify_operator_task_gen(0.1))
    discard_mitex.get_task_graph()


.. image:: combined_mitex_final_taskgraph.png

::

    print(discard_mitex.run([ObservableExperiment(ansatz_circuit_discard, ObservableTracker(qpo_discard))]))

::

    [{(Zq[0], Zq[1], Zq[2]): 1.00000000000000}]

Given our discarding tasks, the expectation value returned in this task is always 1.0.

There are several ``MitEx`` error-mitigation methods available in ``qermit``; Probabilistic-Error-Cancellation [Temme2016]_, 
Zero-Noise-Extrapolation [Giurgica-Tiron2020]_, Clifford Data Regression with Clifford-Circuit-Learning [Czarnik2020]_, and 
Depolarisation-Factor-Supression-For-Nearest-Clifford (an internal method). 
As with ``MitRes``, each is available via a selection of generator functions.

Probabilistic-Error-Cancellation in ``qermit``
----------------------------------------------

Probabilistic-Error-Cancellation (PEC), introduced in [Temme2016]_, utilises that it is 
possible to mitigate for the effect of errors by sampling from a set of erroneous circuits. 
In particular, a linear combination of the expectation values of an observable measured 
on a selection of circuit exposed to noise can give an error mitigated expectation value 
of some fixed primary circuit. Typically this set of circuits is derived from the primary circuit by 
the addition of certain gates, while the coefficients in the linear combination 
depend on the noise channel.

If a precise characterisation of the noise model is available, then a means to arrive at 
both the form and weighting of the set of quantum circuits which perfectly corrects for 
this model is known [Endo2018]_ [Temme2016]_. Unfortunately, such a characterisation can be 
very costly to perform if more than a handful of qubits are involved.

To address this, [Strikis2020]_ introduces a means to learn the appropriate weighting
of the noisy circuits. These coefficients are learnt by minimising the error in the final 
expectation value. As the ideal expectation value of the primary circuit is not known, 
the training is performed using Clifford circuits which are similar in form to the 
primary circuit. The expectation of these Clifford circuits can be calculated efficiently 
using a classical simulator, and so can be compared to the results from noisy runs. 
It is on this approach that the implementation of PEC in ``qermit`` is based.

Generators for Probabilistic-Error-Cancellation ``MitEx`` objects are available in 
the  ``qermit.probabilistic_error_cancellation`` `module <https://cqcl.github.io/qermit/probabilistic_error_cancellation.html>`_.

Let's construct a test case with expected value 1.0 and run the error-mitigation ``MitEx``.

Zero-Noise-Extrapolation in ``qermit``
--------------------------------------

Zero-Noise-Extrapolation (ZNE), introduced concurrently in [Li2017]_ and [Temme2016]_, utilises 
differing effective device noise levels to perform error correction. In particular, 
the results of a computation at a variety of noise levels are used to extrapolate to the 
zero noise limit. This approach acknowledges the difficulty in reducing noise levels, 
but exploits our ability to increase them. As such, there are two selections to be made 
when performing ZNE:

- The means by which the effective noise levels will be varied.
- The method of extrapolation to use to recover the zero noise limit. 


Several options exist in both case. 
Here we will focus on digital ZNE, as discussed in [Giurgica-Tiron2020]_, 
as a means to vary the noise level. Digital ZNE is based on the ability 
to increase noise levels by increasing the number of gates executed. This contrasts with 'analog' 
approaches, which might, for example, alter noise levels by stretching or otherwise changing the 
pulses acted on superconducting qubits. More specifically we increase 
the effective noise by performing a folding operation on the circuit, which increases the 
number of gates without affecting the unitary it implements. At their core these folding 
methods use that, for a gate :math:`G`, :math:`G = G G^{-1} G`, and assume that making this 
substitution has the affect of tripling the noise.

Extrapolation aims to recover an estimate of the expectation value of some observable, 
given measured expectation values at the selection of noise levels facilitated by folding. 
Note that the expectation values and the noise scaling factors are both real numbers. Given these 
collections of values, and an anzats for the relation between the two, this reduces to a 
regression problem. There are several ansatz provided by ``qermit``. Each may have its 
advantages depending on: the device, dominant noise channel, etc.

Generators for Zero-Noise-Extrapolation ``MitEx`` objects are available in 
the ``qermit.zero_noise_extrapolation`` `module <https://cqcl.github.io/qermit/zero_noise_extrapolation.html>`_.

Here the three inputs are: ``backend``, the backend on which the circuits will 
be run; and ``noise_scaling_list``, a list of integer multiples by which the 
noise will be scaled. For each noise scaling value a different ``MitEx`` object is 
constructed. Let's construct a test case with expected value 1.0 and run the 
error-mitigation ``MitEx``.

There are many customisation options available when using the zero-noise-extrapolation ``MitEx`` generator
in ``qermit``, all can be seen via the documentation. 
The type of folding used for creating digitally noisier circuits can be specified via the 
``_folding_type`` keyword argument. This expects a ``Folding`` object, which default has support
for ``gate`` folding and ``circuit`` folding. 
The fit used to extrapolate results can be specified via the ``_fit_type`` keyword argument.
This expects a ``Fit`` object, which default has support for a variety of fits.


Clifford-Circuit-Learning and Clifford-Data-Regression in ``qermit``
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Correcting device noise typically requires some characterisation of what the noise is, while characterising
noise typically requires an understanding of what data would look like *without* noise.

Clifford-Circuit-Learning uses quantum circuits composed primarily of Clifford gates to characterise and correct 
for device noise. As such circuits can be efficiently simulated classically this approach has viable scalability.

Given some experiment circuit to run on some device, a set of state circuits are generated for characterisation. Each 
state circuit is constructed such that it is structurally similar to the experiment circuit, but near Clifford
so that it retains the feature of being efficiently simluated classically. In this method, such near Clifford circuits are 
generated by substituting non-Clifford gates in the experiment Circuit with randomly sampled Clifford gates
from a biased distribution. 

For each state circuit the ideal expectation value is calculated with a simulator for the desired observable, while the noisy expectation value
is calculated by running the circuit on the target device. These results are then used to construct
a model for the noise free value of the observable for states in the vicinity of the state the experiment circuit produces. The original experiment
circuit is then run on the device and its observable estimate corrected by the model.

In this sense, "Clifford-Circuit-Learning" refers to the general noise characterisation approach defined by
efficiently simulated classically Clifford circuits and "Clifford-Data-Regression" refers to the noise correction
technique used here.

Generators for Clifford-Data-Regression ``MitEx`` objects are available in the ``qermit.clifford_noise_characterisation`` `module <https://cqcl.github.io/qermit/clifford_noise_characterisation.html>`_.

We have avoided decomposing all graph nodes before viewing in this case as
there are many nodes required to complete this method (run ``cdr_mitex.decompose_TaskGraph_nodes()``
before viewing if interested).

The ``device_backend`` argument defines the ``Backend`` all noisy state circuit results and the actual
experiment results are retrieved and calculated from. The ``simulator_backend`` argument
defines the ``Backend`` all noiseless state circuit results and retrieved and calculated from.
The ``n_non_cliffords`` arguments defines the number of non-Clifford gates in the produced state circuits
for characterisation. In this construction, state circuits are generated via a Markov Chain
Monte Carlo technique by making small modifications to other state circuits -  the ``n_pairs`` argument
defines the number of non-Clifford state circuit gates converted to Clifford and vice versa (essentially
the 'distance' between generated state circuits). The ``total_state_circuits`` argument defines the total 
number of state circuits constructed for characterisation.

These parameters give a large space for optimising the performance of the given method.
Furthermore, some keyword arguments allow even more customisation.

The ``model`` keyword argument defines the model produced by the characterisation data
and expects a ``_BaseExCorrectModel`` object.
It is by default set to model a linear relationship between noisy and noiseless expectation values, but
the ``_PolyCDRCorect`` class can be used to define other relationships.

In [Czarnik2020]_, a Metropolis-Hastings rule is used to accept or reject state circuits
from the characterisation data. The likelihood function used in this rule can be
defined with the ``LikelihoodFunction`` keyword argument, which expects a ``LikelihoodFunction`` object.
The relationship between performance and choice of ``LikelihoodFunction`` is expected
to be closely linked to the Circuits run, and so by default the likelihood function is set to 
accept all results. Be aware that as ``qermit`` does not support loops currently, this process
is only run after device execution and so if any state circuits are not accepted, no replacement
will be found and so the total number of circuits used in characteriastion will be fewer
than as originally specified.

Lets test with a basic example with expected result 1.0.

For comparison we can run the same experiment without error-mitigation.

    from qermit import MitEx
    mitex = MitEx(noisy_backend)
    exp = [ObservableExperiment(ansatz_circuit, ObservableTracker(QubitPauliOperator({qubit_pauli_string: 1.0})))]
    results = mitex.run(exp)
    print(results)

    [{(Zq[0], Zq[1], Zq[2]): 0.729000000000000}]

For the basic example constructed, fairly small 2000 shots and the ibmq_casablanca device available
through IBMQ, we see that the error-mitigated expectation value is closer to the expected value 1.0 than 
without error-mitigation.

For combining schemes, the ``StatesSimulatorMitex`` keyword argument defines the ``MitEx`` object
for noiseless simluation of all state circuits, the ``StatesDeviceMitex`` keyword argument
defines the ``MitEx`` object for device executions of all state circuits, and the ``ExperimentMitex`` object
defines the ``MitEx`` object all experiment circuits are executed on.

Depolarisation-Factor-Supression-For-Nearest-Clifford in ``qermit``
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This method estimates the averaged incoherent noise component affecting the entire circuit structure
and reduces its effect on computing expectation values. The main advantage of DFSC is that it does 
not require significant quantum resource overhead (no additional ancillas and no increased depth) 
and relies on efficient classical processing. This error-mitigation technique trades-off a finer-grained 
noise characterisation for scalability (i.e reduced computational resources).

The effect of an incoherent Pauli noise channel when computing expectation values of Pauli operators 
for a target state is to scale the exact expected value by a factor that depends on the i) noise channel
and ii) Pauli observable. 

DFSC estimates this factor by assuming that a Clifford circuit derived from the structure of the target 
quantum circuit will incur similar levels of incoherent noise. This factor results from quantum hardware 
evaluation of the Pauli observable's expected value with respect to a state produced by the Clifford circuit 
acting on a positive eigenstate of a forwarded Pauli operator given by the adjoint action of the Clifford 
unitary on the target Pauli observable.

The freedom in the choice of eigenstate can be used to extend the present method to allow finer error 
mitigation at the expense of increased computational resources.

The DFSC method will be most useful when the accumulation of errors through a circuit incurs a loss of 
purity in the state preparation and incoherent errors dominate. It may be used, for example, in a 
variational algorithm to adaptively account for these types of errors within the optimisation loop using 
minimal additional quantum compute time.

Generators for Depolarisation-Factor-Supression-For-Nearest-Clifford ``MitEx`` objects are available 
in the ``qermit.clifford_noise_characterisation`` `module <https://cqcl.github.io/qermit/clifford_noise_characterisation.html>`_.

The DFSC ``MitEx`` expects all non-Clifford gates to be parameterised via the ``SymbolsDict``. Once again,
we construct an example that with expected value 1.0.
